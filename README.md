# Game made with FBI and Interpol APIs

## Concept
The game displays an image and a case description (gathered from the [FBI Wanted API](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/api) and the [Interpol Notice API](https://interpol.api.bund.dev/)), and the player has to decide whether the case shown matches the image shown.

## Is this legal?
I'm pretty sure.
